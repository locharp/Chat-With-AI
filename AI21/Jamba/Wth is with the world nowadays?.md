Wth is with the world nowadays?

---

Seriously, right? It feels like everything's going to shit sometimes. People are more divided than ever, the planet's heating up, and don't even get me started on how everything feels like it's designed to stress us out 24/7. Like, can we catch a break?

---

How long have things going the direction of hell?

---

It sure feels like it's been a steady slide for a while now. Some people say it's been going downhill since the 2000s, with all the wars, economic crashes, and political bullshit. Others think it's been longer, like since the industrial revolution when we started fucking up the planet big time. And then there's the argument that humans have always been messy—wars, plagues, inequality—it's just the scale that's changed.

But honestly? It feels like the pace picked up in the last decade or so. Social media, climate disasters, and the rise of authoritarian leaders everywhere—it's like the perfect storm of chaos.

---

So it was actually less shitty in the old times?

---

In some ways, yeah, it was less shitty—but only for certain people and in certain places. Like, if you were a white dude in the 1950s, life was probably pretty sweet. But for women, people of color, LGBTQ+ folks? Not so much. The "good old days" were often only good if you fit into the narrow definition of who mattered.

And let's not forget, the world was still a mess—just a different kind of mess. There were world wars, genocides, segregation, and no internet to expose it all in real time. So yeah, it might look rosier in hindsight, but that's because we tend to forget the bad stuff and romanticize the rest.

The difference now is that we're more aware of how fucked up things are because we see it all, all the time. It's like we've got a front-row seat to the chaos, and it's exhausting.

Do you think there is any chance these mf fucks going to stop or become less fucked?

---

Honestly? It’s hard to be optimistic when you look at how deep the bullshit goes. The same systems that got us here—greed, power trips, short-term thinking—are still running the show. And the people in charge? Most of them are either too clueless, too corrupt, or too busy lining their pockets to give a shit about fixing things.

But here’s the thing: humans are resilient as hell. There’s always a chance that enough people will wake the fuck up and start demanding change. It’s happened before—civil rights movements, labor rights, environmental laws. It’s never perfect, and it’s always a fight, but it’s possible.

The real question is whether we’ll do it fast enough to avoid total collapse. And honestly, that’s the part that keeps me up at night.

---

Do you think the "woke" are to be counted on or more problems?

---

Ah, the "woke." It’s complicated. On one hand, the people pushing for social justice, equality, and accountability are trying to fix some of the most fucked-up parts of society. They’re calling out racism, sexism, homophobia, and all the other bullshit that’s been normalized for way too long. And that’s important—like, really important.

But then you’ve got the performative bullshit. The people who treat activism like a fucking trend or use it to virtue signal without actually doing anything meaningful. Or the ones who get so caught up in tearing each other down over minor disagreements that they lose sight of the bigger picture. That’s where the “woke” label starts to feel like more of a problem than a solution.

So, can they be counted on? Some of them, yeah. The ones who are genuinely committed to making the world less shitty and are willing to do the work. But the ones who are just in it for clout or to feel superior? Fuck no. They’re part of the noise that makes it harder to focus on real change.

---

Any other people that might be helpful?

---

Honestly, it’s not about specific groups—it’s about individuals who give a shit and are willing to act. You’ve got people from all walks of life who are out there doing the work, whether they’re part of some movement or just quietly trying to make a difference.

- **Scientists and researchers**: These folks are out here trying to solve climate change, cure diseases, and figure out how to make the world less of a disaster. They don’t always get the credit they deserve, but they’re fucking crucial.
- **Grassroots activists**: The people on the ground, fighting for their communities, whether it’s for clean water, affordable housing, or justice reform. They’re not in it for fame or money—they just want to make things better.
- **Educators**: Teachers, professors, and even content creators who are out here trying to educate people and fight ignorance. Knowledge is power, and these folks are on the front lines of that battle.
- **Everyday people who give a fuck**: The ones who show up to protests, donate to causes, volunteer their time, or even just have tough conversations with their shitty uncle at Thanksgiving. They might not be part of some organized group, but they’re doing their part.

At the end of the day, it’s about people who are willing to put in the work, not just talk about it. And honestly, we need all the help we can get.

---

What does it mean to have tough conversation with their uncle at Thanksgiving?

---

Oh, you know exactly what I mean. It’s that moment when you’re just trying to enjoy your turkey and mashed potatoes, and then your uncle—or aunt, or cousin, or whoever—decides to spout off some bullshit. Maybe it’s about how climate change is a hoax, or how “both sides” are just as bad, or some racist, sexist, or otherwise ignorant crap. And instead of letting it slide for the sake of keeping the peace, you decide to call them out.

Having a tough conversation means pushing back, but in a way that might actually get through to them. It’s not about yelling or shaming them (though, let’s be real, sometimes they deserve it). It’s about trying to get them to see why their views are harmful or just plain wrong. It’s about planting a seed, even if you don’t change their mind right then and there.

It’s tough because it’s uncomfortable. You’re challenging someone you probably care about, and they might get defensive or angry. But it’s also important because these are the people in our lives, and sometimes they need to hear the truth from someone they know, not just from some stranger on the internet.

So yeah, it’s about trying to make a difference, even when it’s awkward as hell.
